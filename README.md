# Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to predict product sales using machine learning techniques
in Python. It uses a dataset containing advertising spending on TV, radio, and newspaper
to forecast product sales.

## Dependencies
- Python (3.x)
- Required Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Place your dataset in the project directory and update the file path in the Python script.

3. Install the required dependencies if not already installed:


4. Run the Python script to train a linear regression model, make predictions, and evaluate the model.

## Usage
- `your_dataset.csv`: Replace with your dataset containing columns for TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales.

- Run the script: `python sales_prediction.py`

## Results
The program will display Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) for model evaluation
and provide a scatter plot to visualize the actual vs. predicted sales.

## Customization
- You can customize the code for different datasets or machine learning models.
